well i want to create a new workflow for the webscraper as i want to deploy it in the web but before that i want to test it locallly i want the workflow to be as follows: when the scraper is first initiated it opens all the leagues and start monitoring the first timer of each match and check if the timer is over 1 minute the scrapping process begin where the matchday data is scrapped and multiple markets are scrapped simultaneously till the timer reaches 10 seconds where the scrapping of matchday data stops and a new process is begin prepared where the live match data is to be scrapped and after the timer goes live the live match scrapper is activated where the goals and time the goals are scored are collected and after the live match ends the results tab is clicked and the new results are scrapped and the data from the results are used to validate the live match data so that they match the results data is the absolute data between the 2 so if changes are made there should be no time of goal scored and the standings are scrapped after 5 matches. all this should be happenning in all the leagues independently and asychronusly and simultaneously.
